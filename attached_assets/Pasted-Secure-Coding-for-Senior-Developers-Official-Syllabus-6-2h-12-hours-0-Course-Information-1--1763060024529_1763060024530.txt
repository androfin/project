l have such porject which here l should create lab app for session content practice student there but l need to how l do for example for the topic. code language not matter the importnat developers choice. If you are basing the labs on bWAPP or a specific web app, use whatever language is in the source code of the app and about lab task story something (for example) An idea could be (for example) to use the BWAPP app for XXS or SQLi - have the learner first of all identify a vulnerable SQL query and produce a proof of concept by executing SQL injection in the app and extracting some data. Then identify where in the source code the vulnerability lives and suggest a fix (e.g. switch string concatenation for parameterized query) and present the fixed code
